# Scribble

**Scribble** is a personal project designed to ease the documentation burden for home health clinicians, particularly nurses. 

With a high turnover rate in the field due to the overwhelming amount of paperwork, Scribble offers a solution by listening to nurse-patient conversations during home visits and generating real-time documentation. Nurses can review, edit, and approve the documentation instantly, eliminating the need for post-visit dictation.
